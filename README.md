# Syllabic Numerals

Syllabic numerals are a system of compact number words. In this system, numbers from 0 to 99 each correspond to a word of a single syllable. They are designed primarily for making big numbers easier to remember, rather than for counting. A number like 2022 would in english number words be "two thousand and twenty two", but is in syllabic numerals "dadi".

## The System

Syllabic numerals might be seen as either a base-100 system, or perhaps a mixed base-5 and base-20 system. The numbers 0 to 4 correspond to the five vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u', while the consonants "bcdfghjklmnprstvwxz" correspond to 5, 10, 15, 20 et cetera. So 0 is "a", 1 is "e", 5 is "ba", 6 is "be", 10 is "ca" and so forth.

Numbers of a hundred and above work are constructed by adding additional syllables; 1 is "e", 100 is "ea", 10000 is "eaa".
